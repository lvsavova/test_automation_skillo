# Welcome to Skillo Automation Course!

Hey there, fellow automation enthusiast!

Welcome to the hub of excitement and learning. 🚀 

This repository is your go-to destination throughout the course. Here, we'll upload all the examples we explore during our lectures. And guess what? We're not stopping there! 

We'll also share the lecture homework assignments, because teamwork makes the dream work, right? 🤝 Let's tackle those assignments together and have some inspiring discussions. Get ready to dive into the world of automation awesomeness! 💡🤖

# Structure

This course is logically separated into four parts - Java Fundamentals, REST API, Automation with Selenium and TestNG and Cucumber.
That being said, as we progress, keep your eyes peeled for the evolution of our repository. You'll witness the creation of four main modules ( projects ):

- `java_basics`: IntelliJ module: Will contain lecture subfolders with examples and exercises from the Java Fundamentals lectures
- `automation`: Maven module: Will contain lecture subfolders with examples and exercises from the Automation with Selenium and TestNG lectures
- `rest_api`: Maven module: Will contain the code from the REST API lectures
- `cucumber`: Maven module: Will contain the code from the Cucumber lectures

## Okay, but how do I use it?

Ready for some hands-on action? Let's get you set up!

Getting this repository locally and diving into the examples is as easy as a snap. Here's what you need to do:

1.  **Pull It Locally:** Fire up your Git skills and pull this repository right onto your machine. 
    
2.  **JDK :**  Configure a JDK for the project, but wait – use the golden version recommended for the course. 

Remember you're not here to commit and push.  Create your very own project. Write those examples from scratch, and craft your own homework solutions.

This repository? It's your sidekick. A guiding light that lets you peek into exactly what we're up to during the lectures. Replicate the magic, brew your own coding potions, and if you ever need a nudge in the right direction, here are the homework solutions – just a glance away.







> **Remember:** The pathway to true learning is through hands-on practice. Consider this an open invitation to dedicate your precious time to code. Enjoy!
